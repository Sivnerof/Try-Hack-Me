## Task 1 - Translation and Shifting

Task 1 requires finding 10 flags by translating, shifting or decoding a given string. For this we can use [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/ "CyberChef Website").

### Flag 1

This ones fairly simple and we don't need CyberChef. It's a character replacement system called "[Leet Speak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet "Leet Speak Wikipedia")" that was originally used to evade censorship programs on early online forums. Big in early hacker movements, now it is used mostly ironically.

```
Problem: c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?

Solution: can you capture the flag
```

### Flag 2

To find wether or not binary is being used to convey a message we can first translate the binary to its decimal equivalent and look up the decimal number on an <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> chart. Or we can just copy the binary into [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/ "CyberChef Website") and select "From Binary" in the operations area.

```
Problem: 01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001

Solution: lets try some binary out!
```

### Flag 3

Looking at the string two things should stand out:

1. It's in all caps
2. There's a bunch of equal signs padding the end.

This is an indicator it might be base encoded.

Pasting it into CyberChef and selecting "From Base32" reveals the hidden message.

```
Problem: MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM======

Solution: base32 is super common in CTF's
```

### Flag 4

Again another string with equal signs padding the end. But this time it's only 2. Base64 encoding will never use more than two equal signs. And sometimes won't use any. To read why base32 and base64 pad the end with equal signs you can read this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6916805/why-does-a-base64-encoded-string-have-an-sign-at-the-end "Base64 Question on Stack Overflow").

Plugging the string into CyberChef and selecting "From Base64" reveals the hidden message.

```
Problem: RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==

Solution: Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.
```

### Flag 5

Looking at the problem below we see a series of digit pairs and somethings stand out.

* The digits range from numbers 0-9 and the letters a-f.

Just like [hexadecimal (Base 16)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal Wikipedia") digits.

Each digit pair represents a byte while the single digits represent half a byte (also called a [nibble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble "Nibble Wikipedia")).

To convert a hex byte to its <abbr title="American Standard For Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> equivalent, first convert the hex byte to its decimal representation. Then look up the decimal on an ASCII chart.

| **HEX** | **DECIMAL** | **ASCII** | **DESCRIPTION** |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **68**  | 104         | h         | Lowercase h     |
| **65**  | 101         | e         | Lowercase e     |

| **61**  | 97          | a         | Lowercase a     |
| **64**  | 100         | d         | Lowercase d     |
| **65**  | 101         | e         | Lowercase e     |
| **63**  | 99          | c         | Lowercase c     |
| **69**  | 105         | i         | Lowercase i     |
| **6d**  | 109         | m         | Lowercase m     |
| **61**  | 97          | a         | Lowercase a     |
| **6c**  | 108         | l         | Lowercase l     |
| **20**  | 32          | SP        | Space           |
| **6f**  | 111         | o         | Lowercase o     |
| **72**  | 114         | r         | Lowercase r     |
| **20**  | 32          | SP        | Space           |
| **62**  | 98          | b         | Lowercase b     |
| **61**  | 97          | a         | Lowercase a     |
| **73**  | 115         | s         | Lowercase s     |
| **65**  | 101         | e         | Lowercase e     |
| **31**  | 49          | 1         | One             |
| **36**  | 54          | 6         | Six             |
| **3f**  | 63          | ?         | Question Mark   |

An alternative and much easier way to reveal the hidden message is to paste it into CyberChef and select "From Hex".
