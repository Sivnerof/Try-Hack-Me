## Summary

[Startup](https://tryhackme.com/room/startup "Startup CTF on TryHackMe") is a begginer friendly CTF hosted by [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/ "TryHackMe Official Website") and created by [Elbee](https://tryhackme.com/p/elbee). The room consists of 1 task and 3 flags, and the only description the room gives is the following.

> We are Spice Hut, a new startup company that just made it big! We offer a variety of spices and club sandwiches (in case you get hungry), but that is not why you are here. To be truthful, we aren't sure if our developers know what they are doing and our security concerns are rising. We ask that you perform a thorough penetration test and try to own root. Good luck!
